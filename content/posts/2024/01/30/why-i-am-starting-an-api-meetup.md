## From building APIs

I was always intrigued by APIs. Initially, I enjoyed building them. APIs of all kinds; functions, objects, Java interfaces, libraries, and of course, Web APIs. There's something magical about encapsulating complex information and processes into a single interaction.

## To the business behind them

I fell in love with APIs when I recognized their business significance. Giants like AWS, Twilio, and Stripe have leveraged APIs to build robust, scalable businesses. But it's not just about these big names. APIs take the responsibility to connect different areas of our life. They are used by everyone in our increasingly digital life, often without noticing. Whether adding a concert ticket to a digital wallet or redeeming a loyalty coupon at your local caf√©, APIs are there. For decades (nearly as long as the software practice itself), industries such as banking and telecommunications have relied extensively on APIs to manage and navigate the evolution of their IT systems. And make our lives easier as a result.

## And what it takes

What captivates me most is the real-world, tangible application of APIs. Not how they are crafted with technical perfection or just their ability to handle millions of requests. Instead, understand how they act as a window and a doorway to the business they serve and what it needs technically to make this happen. How tools, protocols, and practices are blended from inception and design to deployment and monitoring. What security concerns may arise, and how can the API evolve to adapt to new business needs?

## Is up to us to explore

If this resonates with you and you're curious about real-world APIs, challenges, and solutions, I invite you to join our community and our first event, [API Athens #B1](https://www.meetup.com/api-athens/events/298630798/). Better still, if you would like to share your story or contribute to the meetup, please email me at [contact@christosgkoros.com](mailto:contact@christosgkoros.com) or use one of my social media.
