## From building APIs

I was always intrigued by APIs. Initially, I liked building them. All types of APIs, from simple functions and objects, Java interface, libraries, and, of course, web APIs. There's something magical about encapsulating complex information and processes into a single interaction.

## To the business behind them

I fell in love with APIs when I recognized their business significance. Giants like AWS, Twilio, and Stripe have leveraged APIs to build robust, scalable businesses. But it's not just about these big names. APIs take the responsibility to connect different areas of our life. Everyone in our increasingly digital lives uses them, often without noticing. Whether adding a concert ticket to a digital wallet or redeeming a loyalty coupon at your local caf√©, APIs are there. Traditional companies in sectors like banking and telecommunications rely heavily on APIS to manage and navigate the evolution of their IT systems, spanning decades (almost as long as the software practice itself). And make our lives easier as a result.

## And what it takes

What captivates me most is the real, tangible application of APIs. Not how they are crafted with technical perfection or their ability to handle millions of requests. Instead, understand how they act as a window and a door to the business they serve. And what does it need technically to make this happen?

What captivates me most are the tangible, real-world applications of APIs. It's not about their technical perfection or ability to handle millions of requests. Instead, it's about understanding how they open doors to new business opportunities and what it takes technically to achieve theirs. How tools, protocols, and practices are blended together from inception and design to deployment and monitoring. What security concerns may arise, and how can they evolve to adapt to new business needs?

## Is up to us to explore
