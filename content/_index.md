Welcome to my space for sharing things I work with, learn or find interesting

## About me

I am a software engineer and architect who specializes in APIs.

I have more than 13+ experience creating software in various industries and technologies, always with a focus on quality. Currently, I am working as an API Architect at Postman, guiding engineering teams to create high-quality APIs and a better product for the millions of developers using Postman.

Both mentor and mentee, I am committed to sharing knowledge in the tech community. I am also the organizer of the [API Athens meetup](https://www.meetup.com/API-Athens/).

## Contact

I am currently living in Athens, Greece, but am available to participate remotely in projects anywhere in the world.
