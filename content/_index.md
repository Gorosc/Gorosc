## About me

I am a seasoned engineering and product professional who specializes in APIs: API Design, Developer Experience, API Product Management, API Governance, and API Platforms.

 With over 14 years of experience, I have developed solutions for diverse industries using various technologies, always emphasizing quality. Currently, I am focusing on API design at Postman, where I lead engineering teams in crafting high-quality APIs to enhance the product experience for the millions of developers who use Postman.

Both mentor and mentee, I am committed to sharing knowledge in the tech community. I am also the organizer of the [API Athens meetup](https://www.meetup.com/API-Athens/).

## Contact

I am currently living in Athens, Greece, but am available to participate remotely in projects anywhere in the world.
