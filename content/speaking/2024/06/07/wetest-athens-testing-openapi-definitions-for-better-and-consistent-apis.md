Here, I present how we test APIs described with the OpenAPI standard internally at Postman. We will cover the objectives of testing, which include ensuring correct structure, completeness, consistency, uniformity, style, and documentation. Additionally, we will explore the tool used for testing, Spectral, and where testing fits in our software delivery lifecycle. Furthermore, we will discuss the challenges we faced, such as testing the tests, scaling the number of tests, and scaling the number of engineering teams involved, and how we overcame them.
