This presentation explores the power of Kubernetes REST API in managing and orchestrating complex workflows within a Kubernetes cluster. We will dive into a practical use case of provisioning resources, demonstrating how to effectively leverage the Kubernetes REST API for this purpose. The session will include hands-on examples using Postman to interact with the Kubernetes API and making API calls to manage cluster resources. Additionally, we will introduce Postman Flows, a feature within Postman that allows for the orchestration of a sequence of API requests.
