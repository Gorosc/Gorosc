Many things in this organization operate in siloes - business functions, business processes, IT applications, infrastructure teams etc - it’s the nature of organizations.

However, this can add cost, complexity, and risk because different teams go in different directions, duplicating things or conflicting with each other - IT is not aligned with the business, or the business itself is not aligned.

In addition, each team / silo is naturally incented to make decisions that are best for them, but not necessarily best for the org as a whole - who is looking at the overall big picture?

An EA team / approach has the opposite incentive - to “optimize for the enterprise”. They do this by executing a process that focuses on aligning across all dimensions, groups, geographies etc - they have the “big picture in mind”, they connect the dots across the siloes.

Ultimately, this big picture alignment should reduce cost risk and complexity, and increase capability and agility.
