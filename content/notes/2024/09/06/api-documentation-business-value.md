The angle from which to look at the business value of API documentation is the "platform." When building it, APIs are the core ingredient and the area where different teams interact.

Poor documentation affects cross-team collaboration, impacting integration times and incident response. It hinders efforts to achieve predictable, fast delivery and efficient operations. This ultimately affects the teams' ability to reach those business goals and costs $$$.

This issue will likely surface in organization-wide surveys.
