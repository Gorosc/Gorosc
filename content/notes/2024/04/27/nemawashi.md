Nemawashi (根回し) in Japanese means an informal process of quietly laying the foundation for some proposed change or project, by talking to the people concerned, gathering support and feedback, and so forth

Put more effort and time into searching for and involving people who either will have strong opinions about a large decision or will be affected by that large decision

The Rule: anyone can make an architectural decision.
The Qualifier: before making the decision, the decision-taker must consult two groups: The first is everyone who will be meaningfully affected by the decision. The second is people with expertise in the area the decision is being taken.
