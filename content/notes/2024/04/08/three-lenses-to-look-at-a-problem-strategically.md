#### Lens 1: The person
In what ways (if any) might the individual be contributing to the problem? (Things like their workstyle, lack of skill, motivation, clarity.)

#### Lens 2: You
In what ways (if any) might you be contributing to the problem? (Maybe you didn’t provide feedback, didn’t set clear expectations.)

#### Lens 3: The team/ organisation
In what ways (if any) might the team/organisation/systems be contributing to the problem? (Things like interdependencies, unclear processes, conflicting priorities.)
