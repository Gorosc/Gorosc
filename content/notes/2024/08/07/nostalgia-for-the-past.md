We tend to say that people were happier in the past because life was simpler. Do you agree with this view?

It is an idealization of the past as we ignore the testimonies and experiences of the misery that plagued people. If we turn to classical literature, we will find that the past is much darker than the present. On the other hand, the present has such bright lights that it often causes vertigo. The strong lights, apart from the starry sky, also prevent us from seeing inside ourselves. And inside the other person. We should see the other forgetting ourselves. But something like this requires a dose of anti-narcissism. And, in our times, this is difficult, if not impossible.
