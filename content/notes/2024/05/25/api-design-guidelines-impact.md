A list of key finding to illustrate the impact of AIP Guidelines in the areas of API consumption and API production:

**API Production:**
- **Increased Requirement Fulfillment**: A controlled developer experiment showed that developers using API Improvement Proposals (AIPs) and an API linter achieved a 10% higher requirement fulfillment rate compared to those without any protocols.
- **Feedback Utility**: Among developers using the linter tool alongside AIPs, 75% found it beneficial, aiding significantly in refining their API designs.
- **Learning Curve**: A noticeable learning curve was present, especially for first-time AIP users, who reported challenges integrating documentation and coding practices.
- **Positive Perception of AIPs**: A high majority (91%) of developers who used AIPs agreed that these protocols were helpful in the API design process.

**API Consumption:**
- **Preference for AIP-aligned Designs**: A significant portion of API consumers (73% of survey participants) expressed a preference for API designs that aligned with AIPs, praising the enhanced usability and comprehensibility these designs offered.
- **Diverse Experience Levels**: The study engaged API consumers with a range of industry experiences, where 56% had less than 7 years and 44% had more than 7 years, demonstrating broad applicability of the findings across experience levels.
- **Quantitative Assessments by AI**: The AI-based tool, API Architect, scored API designs, with those using both AIPs and the API linter generally receiving higher scores. This aligns with the preferences of 73% of human experts who favored these designs.


**API Consumers with Less Than 7 Years of Experience:**
- **Emphasis on Readability and Usability**: Consumers with less than 7 years of experience prioritized technical proficiency and dexterity, favoring APIs that were readable and easy to understand.
- **Preference for Comprehensible APIs**: This group valued APIs that allowed them to clearly comprehend the functionality and structure upon reviewing the code, emphasizing the importance of readability in their API assessments.

**API Consumers with More Than 7 Years of Experience:**
- **Focus on Business Goals and Adaptability**: Consumers with more than 7 years of experience prioritized broader business goals and adaptability, valuing APIs that were agile and suitable for end-user needs.
- **Assessment of Business Value and Problem Solving**: They scrutinized APIs based on their ability to deliver business value and solve problems effectively, reflecting a product-oriented and strategic perspective in their evaluations.
