When a customer brings a complaint, there are always two tokens on the table: “It’s no big deal” and “It’s the end of the world”. Both tokens are always played, so whoever chooses first forces the other to grab the token that’s left. Don’t force your customer into taking the “It’s the end of the world” one.
