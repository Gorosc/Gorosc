In all cases, you should push decisions as far down your org chart as they can go. Consider how much pain and inefficiency you're willing to take, in exchange for people feeling ownership over their goals and mission.

I'd enjoy dictating exactly how our new dashboard should operate, but it's in our organization's best interest to let the dashboard team make those decisions. If I dictate their work, they'll execute on it. If they own their work, they'll feel ownership over the results. They'll care about the product. It will be their customers, and their product, which is key to having a mission.
