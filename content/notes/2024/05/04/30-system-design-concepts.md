1. Use autoscaling for traffic spikes
2. design for scalability from the start
3. plan for and implement fault tolerance
4. prioritize horizontal scaling for scalability
5. implement data partitioning and sharding
6. use data lakes for analytics and reporting
7. employ CDNs for global latency reduction
8. make operations idempotent for simplicity
9. use event-driven architecture for flexibility
10. employ blob/object storage for media files
11. embrace tradeoffs; perfection is unattainable
12. implement Data Replication and Redundancy
13. Implement rate Limiting for system protection
14. use a read-through cache for read-heavy apps
15. utilize write-through cache for write-heavy apps
16. opt for NoSQL Databases for unstructured data
17. use Heartbeat Mechanisms for failure detection
18. adopt WebSockets for real-time communication
19. employ Database Sharding for horizontal scaling
20. clearly define system use cases and constraints
21. consider microservices for flexibility and scalability
22. design for flexibility; expect requirements to evolve
23. utilize Database Indexing for efficient data retrieval
24. understand requirements thoroughly before designing
25. Utilize asynchronous processing for background tasks
26. consider denormalizing databases for read-heavy tasks
27. avoid over-engineering; add functionality only as needed
28. prefer SQL Databases for structured data and transactions
29. use Load Balancers for high availability and traffic distribution
30. consider message queues for asynchronous communication
