You might step into a mentoring mode when you are sharing your experiences, offering advice and knowledge. If you're a leader in tech, you likely overindex on mentoring because it's easy. Because you're proud of your expertise and you want to share and help.

Often, a more appropriate mode is to use a coaching mode. In coaching, you careful listen, ask questions and you help someone uncover their own approach to their own problem/challenge. Coaching is especially powerful if you're trying to empower someone because people will have more ownership and autonomy because it's their solution and not yours
